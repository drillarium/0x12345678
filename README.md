## Overview
Traditionally, actions like adding a corporate logo to a transport stream involves decoding the stream, overlaying the logo, and re-encoding the stream. While functional, this approach has several drawbacks, including loss of video quality, higher computational requirements, and increased latency.

To solve these issues, we propose a novel protocol that avoids the need for recompression. Instead of modifying the original video stream, our solution demultiplexes the transport stream, adds a new stream containing the logo, and transmits this enhanced stream to a compatible receiver. The receiver decodes the original stream, combines it with the logo stream, and renders the final output, preserving video quality and minimizing latency. A new concept called SMT (Stream Manipulation Table) has been defined to execute this type of actions on the receiver side.

## Key Advantages

### 1. Avoids Extra Recompression
- **Traditional issue:** Decoding and re-encoding a stream reduces video quality and increases the bitrate.
- **Solution benefit:** Our protocol eliminates the need for recompression, preserving the original video quality and reducing the risk of artifacts.

### 2. Improved Computational Efficiency
- **Traditional issue:** Decoding and re-encoding require significant CPU and GPU resources, especially for high-definition or live streams.
- **Solution benefit:** By simply adding a new stream, we avoid the resource-heavy steps of decoding and encoding, making the process much more efficient.

### 3. Lower Latency
- **Traditional issue:** Recompression adds significant processing time, which increases latency.
- **Solution benefit:** Our protocol directly manipulates the transport stream, minimizing the time required to process and deliver the final output.

### 4. Flexibility in the Receiver
- **Traditional issue:** The logo is typically embedded directly into the video, leaving no room for dynamic customization.
- **Solution benefit:** The new protocol allows the receiver to interpret the logo stream independently. This enables dynamic adjustments, such as regional or time-specific logos, or even ignoring the logo if needed.

### 5. Scalability for Large Networks
- **Traditional issue:** Centralized decoding and re-encoding create bottlenecks in large-scale systems.
- **Solution benefit:** By offloading the logo rendering to the receiver, we reduce the load on central servers, making the system more scalable for large networks or streaming platforms.

### 6. Preservation of the Original Transport Stream
- **Traditional issue:** Direct modifications to the transport stream can disrupt synchronization or introduce compatibility issues.
- **Solution benefit:** The original stream remains untouched, ensuring compatibility with legacy devices while extending functionality for modern receivers.

### 7. Reduced Bandwidth Usage
- **Traditional issue:** Re-encoded streams often require higher bitrates to maintain quality.
- **Solution benefit:** The logo stream adds minimal overhead to the total bandwidth, making the protocol efficient for transmission over limited networks.

### 8. Differentiation and Innovation
- **Competitive advantage:** This protocol represents a unique, innovative approach that can set our solution apart from competitors reliant on traditional methods.
- **Commercial potential:** The protocol could become a key differentiator, appealing to clients who value quality, efficiency, and scalability.

### 9. Hardware Compatibility
- **Adaptable design:** Modern receivers already support processing multiple streams in a transport stream, enabling seamless integration of our protocol without requiring specialized hardware.

### 10. Real-World Use Cases
- **Dynamic branding:** Regional broadcasters can overlay localized logos without affecting the global feed.
- **Event-specific overlays:** Sporting events can dynamically add sponsor logos or other overlays in real-time.

### 11. Cost Savings
- **Infrastructure savings:** Reduces the need for high-performance hardware for decoding and re-encoding.
- **Development savings:** Simplifies the pipeline by avoiding costly recompression workflows.

### 12. Enhanced User Experience
- **Better quality:** Users receive the highest possible video quality, free of recompression artifacts.
- **Low latency:** Especially important for live streams, where minimal delay is critical.

## Conclusion
This protocol not only addresses the inefficiencies of traditional methods but also introduces a forward-thinking, scalable approach to adding overlays to transport streams. By preserving video quality, reducing computational overhead, and offering unparalleled flexibility, this solution represents a significant leap forward in transport stream processing.

We invite you to explore this project further and contribute to its development. Together, we can redefine how overlays are managed in modern video transport streams.
